Mumbai is India\u2019s most\ncosmopolitan city, its financial powerhouse, and the nerve centre of India\u2019s fashion industry.\nMumbai is also dotted with plenty of architectural landmarks from the Victorian era and the\ndays of Raj. Mumbai is also the birthplace of Indian Cinema.\nLocated on Maharashtra\u2019s coast, Mumbai is India\u2019s most-populous city, and it is one of the\nlargest and most densely populated urban areas in the world. Mumbai developed a highly\ndiversified infrastructure. \nIt suffers, however, from some of the perennial problems of many large expanding industrial\ncities: air and water pollution, widespread areas of substandard housing, and overcrowding.\nWith its diverse society, comes diverse infrastructure which decides the quality of living. There\nare many infrastructures in Mumbai, each belonging to different categories like Drinking Water?\nPlant, Waste Water/ Sewage, Hospitals, Schools, Colleges, Railway Network, Electricity Power\nPlants, Telecommunication Support, Bank, Shopping malls, Supermarket, Gas Station, Hotels,\nPolice Station, Caf\u00e9, medical shops, grocery shops, theatre, etc. One of the main problems,\nwhen one moves to a new city, is where to find a good area to build and grow prosperously."
